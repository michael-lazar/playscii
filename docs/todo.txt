TODO

is there a way to determine when a class default has been changed and should / shouldn't override serialized data?

collision:
- write up specific question(s) for next video
- debug viz for contacts (create on contact start, destroy on contact end)
- fix player->static collisions - shouldn't jitter
- fix player->dynamicBB collisions

edit mode:
- right panel: generic properties view to edit selected instance's properties
-- if multiple selected, show only title bar "3 Selected" etc
-- reset to class defaults
-- toggle lock/unlock location
-- toggle object visible
- left panel of edit mode buttons:
-- return to art mode
-- hide edit UI (shows message with key to unhide)
-- load state
-- save state
-- reset to start state
-- spawn something (dialog to specify class) (mouse pick location?)
-- set game dir
-- select a particular object (chooser UI?)
- key to toggle this UI?  think about overall "edit quasimode" design

further work on existing features:

Tools menu: after separator, same tool settings as can be accessed in popup

menu bar - when alt pressed, grey/darker bg on character that is an item's accelerator

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
- arrow keys navigate between char and color pickers properly

shift-O: toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp)

human-readable errors if charset/palette not found

if psci files get too huge, compress em with python's zipfile module (different extension needed?) as the json zips extraordinarily well
