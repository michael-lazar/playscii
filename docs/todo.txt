TODO

menu:
- layer:
-- add new layer... (dialog: name, z depth)
-- duplicate current layer... (dialog: name of new layer, z depth)
-- delete current layer
- char/color:
-- load charset
-- load palette
-- both use "picker" interface: left pane showing names, right pane with preview (appropriately scaled sprite renderable)

- keyboard shortcut for dialog 3rd buttons, eg "don't save"
- some way to allow arrow keys to navigate pulldown menu?
-- left/right: next/previous menu in menu bar (easy?)
-- up/down: simulate hover of next/previous item in pulldown (harder)

- clickable dialog fields - when clicked skip cursor focus to it
- click-drag to move dialogs by menubar?

- full about/credits

- resizing art creates bg color on all layers; all but "base" layer should be transparent
-- what is "base" layer though?

mockup for frame/layer matrix

games/ dir, contains art and "game scripts". playscii can be launched with "-game [gamename]" arg to launch straight into a game.  eventually, framework for hot-reloaded object system grows from this

---

further work on existing features:

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
- arrow keys navigate between char and color pickers properly

O key: toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp)

human-readable errors if charset/palette not found

separate camera for game mode

further-out UI stuff in docs/ui.txt

if psci files get too huge, compress em with python's zipfile module (different extension needed?) as the json zips extraordinarily well
