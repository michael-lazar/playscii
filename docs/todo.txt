TODO

shorten game dir in game edit panel titlebar

state load / live reload: is there a way to determine when a class default has been changed and should / shouldn't override serialized data?

collision:
- debug viz for contacts (create on contact start, destroy on contact end)
- fix player->static collisions - shouldn't jitter
- fix player->dynamicBB collisions

consider using http://contributor-covenant.org officially

further work on existing features:

menu bar - when alt pressed, grey/darker bg on character that is an item's accelerator

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
- arrow keys navigate between char and color pickers properly

shift-O: toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp)

human-readable errors if charset/palette not found

if psci files get too huge, compress em with python's zipfile module (different extension needed?) as the json zips extraordinarily well
