identify bugs with current undo/redo and paint tools, squash the must-fix ones and log the lower priority ones!
troubleshooting undo/redo: good visualization of current stack

mockup for menu bar, frame/layer matrix

PNG export:
- 1:1 offscreen render target size = charset char size * art size; quad size = render target size / art size
-- CRT off/on just runs the same post-proc shader or not?
- determine if current CRT shader meets visual quality standard for PNG export.  CRT on/off setting respected in exported art.
- lead on aniGIF export: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- arrow keys navigate pickers as well as mouse?
-- how to resolve transitions between char and color swatches?

ability to toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp?)

ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
