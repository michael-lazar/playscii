TODO

for 0.5.0:

onion skinning:
- O toggles
- create two (or N) extra renderables of active art, render them before rest of scene
- user control for: [show only next frames, only previous frames, both], # of frames to show, max skin opacity?

mockup for frame/layer matrix

games/ dir, contains art and "game scripts". playscii can be launched with "-game [gamename]" arg to launch straight into a game.  eventually, framework for hot-reloaded object system grows from this

OSX glGenTextures crash: happens when SDL 2D renderer has been created

---

further work on existing features:

menu bar - when alt pressed, grey/darker bg on character that is an item's accelerator

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
- arrow keys navigate between char and color pickers properly

shift-O: toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp)

human-readable errors if charset/palette not found

separate camera for game mode

further-out UI stuff in docs/ui.txt

if psci files get too huge, compress em with python's zipfile module (different extension needed?) as the json zips extraordinarily well

image import:
- faster faster
