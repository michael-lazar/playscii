TODO

- fix collision offset on cronotest railing
- rework test1 game data to use new system

continue sorting work:
- split cronotest scene into multiple objects: front wall

collision:
- write up specific question(s) for next video
- debug viz for contacts (create on contact start, destroy on contact end)
- fix player->static collisions - shouldn't jitter
- fix player->dynamicBB collisions

edit mode:
- generic properties window to edit a selected instance's properties
- left-side command panel for loading/saving state, spawning stuff, etc
- key to toggle this UI?  think about overall "edit quasimode" design

---

further work on existing features:

Tools menu: after separator, same tool settings as can be accessed in popup

menu bar - when alt pressed, grey/darker bg on character that is an item's accelerator

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
- arrow keys navigate between char and color pickers properly

shift-O: toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp)

human-readable errors if charset/palette not found

if psci files get too huge, compress em with python's zipfile module (different extension needed?) as the json zips extraordinarily well

mockup for frame/layer matrix - is this still needed now that onion skin + layer pulldown list give a pretty good-enough view of this data?

should game dirs have their own palettes/, charsets/ etc subdirs?
