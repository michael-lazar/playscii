TODO

menu:
- layer:
-- UI works, finish underlying functionality for add/duplicate/delete layer
- char/color:
-- make thumbnail preview show up properly
-- select should select the item and show preview, not instantly set the active art's char/pal
-- up/down arrows navigate selected item too
-- make charset and palette lines in popup clickable buttons that (close popup &) take you to their respective pickers

onion skinning!
- O toggles
- create two (or N) extra renderables of active art, render them before rest of scene

- full about/credits

- resizing art creates bg color on all layers; all but "base" layer should be transparent
-- what is "base" layer though?

mockup for frame/layer matrix

games/ dir, contains art and "game scripts". playscii can be launched with "-game [gamename]" arg to launch straight into a game.  eventually, framework for hot-reloaded object system grows from this

---

further work on existing features:

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
- arrow keys navigate between char and color pickers properly

O key: toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp)

human-readable errors if charset/palette not found

separate camera for game mode

further-out UI stuff in docs/ui.txt

if psci files get too huge, compress em with python's zipfile module (different extension needed?) as the json zips extraordinarily well
