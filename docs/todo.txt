TODO

main popup!
- spacebar brings it up
- two panes: tool and picker
- tool: left bar selects, right side has tool properties. just paint, grab, and erase for now; fixed 1 tile brush size
- picker: character set and palette, with grid overlay to make boundaries clear
-- how to convey "this char/color is selected"?  fg vs bg color?
-- how to convey "transparent"?  make it look like this in status bar too
- don't move cursor while popup is up - arrow keys navigate picker

- "export to PNG" feature - how? 1:1 sized offscreen render target? does getting pixels from framebuffer preserve alpha?
-- smart people say: try glReadPixels, make sure framebuffer contains an alpha (it should, pixel format is RGBA)
-- is color distortion inherent in how good CRT filters work?

ability to toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp?)

FIX:


low priority:

- headbrain2.ed is corrupted, figure out if it can be salvaged with smart parsing - maybe provide a "width override" option?

problem discovered during 2015-01-04~06:
GLSL really can't handle int/uint attributes!  charIndex looks fine in numpy int32 array data but comes into GLSL totally screwy.  works fine when the array and attribute are floats instead.  bug for PyOpenGL devs?
possible test program: two quads side by side, each doing some trivial shader that involves an arbitrary number, only difference being one is driven by an int attribute and the other by a float.
