mockup for menu bar, frame/layer matrix

MenuBar(UIElement), row of buttons that invoke the pulldown menu in different places
- menu bar buttons -> show PulldownMenu at self.x,self.y+1, populate it with items from our menu item table

PulldownMenu(UIElement), size and position are set by a menubar button, populated from its table.  menu items have a name, a keyboard shortcut, and an associated command.  some commands run something immediately, others invoke the DialogBox and wait for input.  hide and reset menubar button that invoked us if user clicks anywhere but here

DialogBox(UIElement), prompts user for input in one or more fields, cancel button bails, confirm button runs command based on input, confirm button only active if current text field(s) input is valid, all other UI input is locked out.  created when invoked, set to ui's "active dialog box" var, destroyed on cancel/confirm.  (how to remember values?  set class properties for field defaults on confirm?)
dialog box subclasses: title, confirm button label (verb, not just "ok") # and size of fields, field labels, "valid input" checker function, function to run once confirm is pressed.
keys that work while focused: enter (confirm), tab (navigates between fields), backspace, alt-backspace, esc (cancel)
make sure these can be invoked from anywhere, eg directly from keyboard shortcuts or other UI, not just pulldown menu items

further work on existing features:

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
- arrow keys navigate between char and color pickers properly

O key: toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp)

human-readable errors if charset/palette not found

separate camera for game mode
