TODO

identify and fix specific undo weirdness bugs

update title bar when saving as a new file

mockup for menu bar, frame/layer matrix

game mode renderer feasibility/perf test:
- get several (6?) arts loaded, spawn multiple renderables for each, have them all moving around, some animating, some with scripts running on them
-- one large multi layer environment like piece
-- one with a different character set?
-- one "player" art w/ multiple layers controllable, ie alt-arrows move it, something else moves it in Z axis
-- one script-driven art like a particle effect
-- one "enemy" art w/ multiple frames
- things to check:
-- do overlapping, multi-layer arts sort correctly?
-- how's perf?

further work on existing features:

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
- arrow keys navigate pickers as well as mouse?
-- how to resolve transitions between char and color swatches?

O key: toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp)

human-readable errors if charset/palette not found
