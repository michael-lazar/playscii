TODO

move c64 charset to c64_edscii, make petscii editor's arrangement the new default

text entry tool!
- click/enter to start text entry at cursor location, remember entry start X,Y
- if input character is in charset's map, write that index, move to next char (go to X,Y+1 if hitting end, bail if hitting last char in art)
- ESC / arrow key / right click anywhere bails out of entry mode, adds command to undo buffer
- click/enter also adds command to undo buffer, but keeps entry mode active

expected edit behavior:
don't allow FG paints on tiles with char 0
-- UITool: "get tile mod" for each tile in a paint op, eg incrementing rotation, no FG paint on char 0 tiles, etc

character swatch: extra line below charset name and scale, showing "flip: -/X/Y", "rotate: 0/90/180/270", affects all tiles in swatch, selecting a char sets the paint tool's xform
- status bar shows selected xform to right of BG
- need a better user-facing term than "xform"

select tool
- K, left click draws/adds to existing selection, right click / alt-left click subtracts from selection, ctrl-a selects all, ctrl-d selects none, ctrl-i inverts selection.  selection area outlined with a pulsing white LineRenderable.
- refresh selection outline (once) each time a tile is added or removed from selection: iterate over all selected tiles, apply rules to draw lines at its borders, pass lines to line renderable
- paint tool operations only affect selected tiles
- selection follows changes of active layer
- ctrl-x ctrl-c ctrl-v work as expected.  del erases selected area to BG. ctrl-v creates a preview on cursor, a la edscii

mockup for menu bar, frame/layer matrix

further work on existing features:

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- arrow keys navigate pickers as well as mouse?
-- how to resolve transitions between char and color swatches?

ability to toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp?)

ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
