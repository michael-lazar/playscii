TODO

mockup for dialog box, frame/layer matrix

- confirm button only active if current text field(s) input is valid?
-- dialog box subclasses: "valid input" checker function
- how to remember values?  set class properties for field defaults on confirm?
- keys that work while focused: tab (navigates between fields), alt-backspace

new art dialog:
- name is only valid if there's not already an art loaded named that
- only allow w/h between 1 and [reasonable max value, eg 10000?]

close command (ctrl w):
- pops up same unsaved changes dialog as quit

multi-field dialog example:
- resize art: new width and height, X and Y origin
- accept only numeric input

some way to allow arrow keys to navigate pulldown menu?
- left/right: next/previous menu in menu bar (easy?)
- up/down: simulate hover of next/previous item in pulldown (harder)

further work on existing features:

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
- arrow keys navigate between char and color pickers properly

O key: toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp)

human-readable errors if charset/palette not found

separate camera for game mode

further-out UI stuff in docs/ui.txt

if psci files get too huge, compress em with python's zipfile module (different extension needed?) as the json zips extraordinarily well
