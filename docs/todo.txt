TODO

main popup!
- tool pane: left bar selects, right side has tool properties. just paint, grab, and erase for now; fixed 1 tile brush size
- arrow keys navigate picker as well as mouse?

- "export to PNG" feature - how? 1:1 sized offscreen render target? does getting pixels from framebuffer preserve alpha?
-- smart people say: try glReadPixels, make sure framebuffer contains an alpha (it should, pixel format is RGBA)
-- is color distortion inherent in how good CRT filters work?

ability to toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp?)

later UI stuff in docs/ui.txt

FIX:

rewrite Cursor.screen_to_world to produce same results as gluUnProject:
https://www.opengl.org/wiki/GluProject_and_gluUnProject_code
https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man2/xhtml/gluUnProject.xml

low priority:

- headbrain2.ed is corrupted, figure out if it can be salvaged with smart parsing - maybe provide a "width override" option?

problem discovered during 2015-01-04~06:
GLSL really can't handle int/uint attributes!  charIndex looks fine in numpy int32 array data but comes into GLSL totally screwy.  works fine when the array and attribute are floats instead.  bug for PyOpenGL devs?
possible test program: two quads side by side, each doing some trivial shader that involves an arbitrary number, only difference being one is driven by an int attribute and the other by a float.
