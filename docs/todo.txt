TODO

menu:
- art:
-- crop to selection
-- resize
-- [list of loaded art]
- frame:
-- add frame to end
-- insert after frame #
-- duplicate #
-- delete current frame
-- change order (what does dialog for this look like?)
-- change current delay
- layer:
-- add layer to end
-- duplicate #
-- remove current layer
-- change current layer's Z
- help: launch website?

- remember previous dialog values?  set class properties for field defaults on confirm?
- some way to allow arrow keys to navigate pulldown menu?
-- left/right: next/previous menu in menu bar (easy?)
-- up/down: simulate hover of next/previous item in pulldown (harder)

- full about/credits

mockup for frame/layer matrix

further work on existing features:

PNG export:
- CRT off/on affects PNG output, according to a scale factor.
-- arg 1 of export console command = scale factor override, default is Nx
- aniGIF export for animations - lead: http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.python/save-animated-gif-in-python-image-library/1632384

main popup
- "use global settings" toggle for tools with an "affects X" mask - when true, setting one of the current tool's masks changes all tool's masks
- ability to "pin" popup so it stays on screen always
- arrow keys navigate between char and color pickers properly

O key: toggle between perspective and ortho views (steal unity's cool lerp)

human-readable errors if charset/palette not found

separate camera for game mode

further-out UI stuff in docs/ui.txt

if psci files get too huge, compress em with python's zipfile module (different extension needed?) as the json zips extraordinarily well
