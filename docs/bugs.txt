bug list

some cursor preview commands "stick" and can't be undone if cursor is hovering tiles affected by a redo

tile coords in status bar have negative Y only when text tool is active?!

PNG export: layers that have too high a Z won't show up in export, special-case behavior for near/far Z in renderable export?

rewrite Cursor.screen_to_world to produce same results as gluUnProject:

problem discovered during 2015-01-04~06:
GLSL really can't handle int/uint attributes!  charIndex looks fine in numpy int32 array data but comes into GLSL totally screwy.  works fine when the array and attribute are floats instead.  bug for PyOpenGL devs?
possible test program: two quads side by side, each doing some trivial shader that involves an arbitrary number, only difference being one is driven by an int attribute and the other by a float.
