bug list

quick grab is broken!

- open any art, paint once, undo it, paint again, undo it: only undoes about half the command, undo again it does all but the 1st click's edit, undo again and it undoes.

painting is broken for non-square charsets: changes in Y seem magnified as cursor Y increases.  probably some place in cursor.update that's assuming 1:1 aspect when it shouldn't.

status bar breaks when UI scale changes

status bar becomes unreadable when window's horizontal scale goes low enough - check if left-side items even fit on screen before bothering to draw right-side items

little annoying cracks between quads - UV or vert/element error?

rewrite Cursor.screen_to_world to produce same results as gluUnProject:

low priority:

problem discovered during 2015-01-04~06:
GLSL really can't handle int/uint attributes!  charIndex looks fine in numpy int32 array data but comes into GLSL totally screwy.  works fine when the array and attribute are floats instead.  bug for PyOpenGL devs?
possible test program: two quads side by side, each doing some trivial shader that involves an arbitrary number, only difference being one is driven by an int attribute and the other by a float.
