  Painting Basics
  A Playscii document is a grid of tiles called an Art. Each tile in an Art has a character, a foreground color, a background color, and a transform. Click and hold the primary mouse button, or the Enter/Return key, anywhere on a document to paint with the active character/color/transform.
  
  Tile Character/Color/Transform
  Character and foreground/background color are pretty self-explanatory. "Transform" refers to whether a character is flipped (horizontally or vertically, aka the X and Y axes) or rotated (90, 180, or 270 degrees). The current active character, colors, and transform are always shown on the status bar along the bottom edge of the screen.

  In this image, the 'A' character is selected, green is the foreground color, blue is the background color, and the transform is "normal", ie not flipped or rotated.
  
  Transparency
  In addition to the regular colors, the foreground and/or background color for a tile can also be transparent. Anything transparent shows through to whatever (if anything) is behind it. In Playscii's user interface, this special color is visually represented with a red X.

  In this image, the '7' character is selected, green is the foreground color, the background is transparent, and the transform is "Flip X" ie flipped horizontally.
  
  The Picker
  Press space to bring up the "picker" that lets you select characters, colors, and transforms.
  [image of picker, with #s at each UI element]
  1. Character swatch - click a character here to set it as the active character for painting.
  2. Color swatch - click the primary mouse button on a color here to set it as the active foreground color, secondary mouse click to set it as the active background color.
  3. Tool/picker tabs - click the left tab to bring up settings for each tool (see [Tools] and [Affects Masks] sections below), click the right tab to bring up the picker view.
  4. Transform selector - click one of the items here to set a different active transform (see [transform] section above).
  5. Current character set - click this to bring up the [character set selector].
  6. Current palette - click this to bring up the [palette selector].
  7. Character swatch size - click the + and - buttons to change the character swatch's display size - bump it up if characters are too hard to see or click on your display.
  
  Menu Bar
  The menu bar along the top edge of the screen provides access to much of Playscii's functionality. Click a menu name to open it and select from the available commands. Many commands have an associated keyboard shortcut, displayed to the right of the menu entry.
  
  Tools
  You can select your current tool from the Tool menu bar.
  - Paint: change the tiles within the cursor area to the current active character/colors/transform.
  - Erase: "erase" the tiles within the cursor area, removing characters and leaving only the <i>current active</i> background color.
  - Rotate: rotate the tiles within the cursor area 90 degrees, relative to each character's current rotation.
  - Grab: set the character/color/transform of the tile beneath the cursor as the current active character/color/transform. Secondary mouse button does this no matter what tool you have selected, so that you can very quickly sample what you need and continue painting.
  - Text: click anywhere in the document to start entering alphanumeric text at that location. Press the Escape key to stop entering text.
  - Select: click and drag the mouse (or use enter + arrow keys) to define a selected area. Other tool operations will be restricted to the selection area, and you can also cut/copy the selected area and paint it with the Paste tool (see below). Holding the shift key while dragging a box adds to the current selection area, and holding control while dragging a box subtracts it from the current selection area. Holding neither mod key replaces any previous selection.
  - Paste: paint with the last cut/copied tiles.
  
  Tool Settings
  The Picker lets you change the settings for some tools:
  - Brush Size: increase or decrease the size of the square area a tool affects. Doesn't apply to the grab, text, select, and paste tools.
  - "Affects character / foreground color / background color / transform" masks: by default a tool will affect all of these things, but a tool's effect on each tile attribute can be disabled selectively. Hovering the cursor over a swatch will always preview the paint result, which might otherwise be a bit difficult to visualize.

  Panning and Zooming
  To zoom the view closer or further from the document you're editing, press shift-X or shift-Z respectively or scroll the mouse wheel up or down.
  To pan the view, use shift and the arrow keys or W/A/S/D (up/left/down/right), or click and drag the middle mouse button.
  You can also set the zoom level manually with "Set camera zoom..." in the View menu.
  You can also tilt the camera with "Camera tilt" in the View menu, but this isn't useful for much and is a bit broken at the moment.
  
  Grid
  By default Playscii display a light grid over your art showing the boundaries of each tile, but you can turn this off with "Grid" in the View menu.
  
  CRT Filter
  By default, Playscii displays your work with a screen effect that emulates the look of old TVs or Monitors, ie cathode ray tubes. You can disable this with "CRT filter" in the View menu, or pressing shift-R. If Playscii runs slowly on your computer, try disabling the CRT filter.
  
  Working with Documents
  You can save the current document, create a new document, and open a previously saved document from the File menu. You can have multiple documents open at the same time and switch between them by pressing ctrl-Tab, while shift-ctrl-Tab cycles backwards through open documents.
  You can also see a list of all open documents at the bottom of the Art menu.
  
  Cropping and Resizing
  You can crop a document by selecting an area with the [Select] tool and selecting "Crop to selection" from the Art menu.
  You can resize a document with "Resize" from the Art menu. This opens a dialog where you can enter the new desired size. If the desired size is smaller than the current size, you can specify a tile to be the new top left corner in the "Crop Start X/Y" fields.
  
  layers
  Playscii documents can have multiple layers, similar to raster image editing programs like Photoshop. You can position these layers in 3D space for a parallax effect.
  In the Layer menu, you can create a new blank layer with "Add layer" or duplicate an existing layer with "Duplicate this layer". The dialog will ask you to enter a name for the layer (purely for ease of identification) and a "Z-depth", ie how far from the default base depth, you want the layer to appear at. The following two Layer menu items let you change these two respective values.
  If you're working with a document that has more than one layer, only one layer at a time is "active"
  When working on a particular layer, sometimes you want to see the other layers and sometimes you don't. "Inactive layers: Visible/Dim/Invisible" cycles through three settings: all layers are 100% visible, non-active layers are dim but still partially visible, and non-active layers are completely hidden.

  character set selector
  By default Playscii lets you paint with the Commodore 64 "PETSCII" character set, but it supports many other sets out of the box, and you can [define your own]. The character set selector lets you pick from the the available sets.

  palette selector
  Similar to the [character set selector], this selector lets you choose a different color palette from the default Commodore 64 palette. You can also [define your own] with nothing more than an image.
