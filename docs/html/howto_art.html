  painting basics
  a playscii document is a grid of tiles. each tile has a character, a foreground color, a background color, and a transform. click and hold the primary mouse button (or enter) anywhere on a document to paint the active character/color/transform.
  
  tile character/color/transform
  Character and color are pretty self-explanatory; "transform" refers to whether a character is flipped (horizontally or vertically, aka the X and Y axes) or rotated (90, 180, or 270 degrees). The current active character, colors, and transform are always shown on the status bar along the bottom edge of the screen.
  
  the picker
  press space to bring up the "picker" that lets you select characters, colors, and transforms (flipped or rotated versions of all characters).
  [image of picker, with #s at each UI element]
  1. Character swatch - click a character here to set it as the active character for painting
  2. Color swatch - click the primary mouse button on a color here to set it as the active foreground color, secondary mouse click to set it as the active background color
  3. Tool/picker tabs - click the left tab to bring up settings for each tool (see [Tools] and [Affects Masks] sections below), click the right tab to bring up the picker view.
  4. Transform selector - click one of the items here to set a different active transform (see [transform] section above).
  5. Current character set - click this to bring up the [character set selector].
  6. Current palette - click this to bring up the [palette selector].
  7. Character swatch size - click the + and - buttons to change the character swatch's display size - bump it up if characters are too hard to see or click on your display.
  
  tools
  - paint: change the tiles within the cursor area to the current active character/colors/transform into the current document.
  - erase: "erase" the tiles within the cursor area, removing characters and leaving only the current active background color.
  - rotate: rotate the tiles within the cursor area 90 degrees, relative to each character's current rotation.
  - grab: set the character/color/transform of the tile beneath the cursor as the current active character/color/transform. secondary mouse button does this no matter what tool you have selected, so you can very quickly sample what you need and continue painting.
  - text: click anywhere in the document to start entering alphanumeric text at that location.
  - select: click and drag the mouse (or use enter + arrow keys) to define a selected area. other tool operations will be restricted to the selection area, and you can also cut/copy the selected area and paint it with the paste tool (see below). Holding the shift key while dragging a box adds to the current selection area, and holding control while dragging a box subtracts it from the current selection area.
  - paste: paint with the last cut/copied tiles.
  
  tool settings
  - brush size: increase or decrease the size of the square area a tool affects. doesn't apply to the grab, text, select, and paste tools.
  - "affects character / foreground color / background color / transform" masks: by default a tool will affect all of these things, but a tool's effect on each tile attribute can be disabled selectively. hovering the cursor over a swatch will preview the paint result, which might otherwise be a bit difficult to visualize.

  character set selector
  By default Playscii lets you paint with the Commodore 64 "PETSCII" character set, but it supports many other sets out of the box, and you can [define your own]. The character set selector lets you pick from the the available sets.

  palette selector
  Similar to the [character set selector], this selector lets you choose a different color palette from the default Commodore 64 palette. You can also [define your own] with nothing more than an image.
